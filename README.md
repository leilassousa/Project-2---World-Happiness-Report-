## Project-2-World-Happiness-Report

# University Of Toronto: FinTech Bootcamp

# Project Title: World Happiness Report Analysis
# Collaborators: Leila Sousa

# Project Description/Outline
The project aims to analyze the Happiness Scores of countries for the period 
2015-2018. In particular we will look at the factors that drive the happiness 
scores of sovereigns and also if these factors have remained constant for the 
period under review. In addition, using Machine Learning models, cluster 
countries according to common features and will aim to make a prediction for 
the 2019 World Happiness Report.  

# Research Question to be Answered
Using statistics from the World Happiness Report, we will look to answer the 
following questions:
-What are the main factors that promote happiness in a country?
-Have these factors remained stable over the years?
-Which are the Top 3 countries that have improved/declined the most?
-Using Machine Learning clustering algorithms, will we be able to forecast the ranking for the 2019 Report?

# Datasets to be Used
2015 â€“ 2019 World Happiness Reports sourced from Kaggle.

# Breakdown of Tasks
1) Import and clean datasets for each of the years.
2) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to identify changes in the factors for 
the countries across the years.
3) Run datasets for 2015-2018 through a clustering model (K-Means, Support
Vector Machine, Random Forest) assess models scores.
4) Using the best model make a prediction for 2019 country happiness 
rankings.
